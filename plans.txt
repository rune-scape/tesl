slots and signals: useful for game/gui development
user defined structs/objects
possibly a bare struct type and also a more featurefull object type 
packed and aligned data
typed packed dynamic/static arrays/maps
member access is named lookup of a member variable/function
named symbols are interned in their own global (per-env) pool and accessed as array indices for speed
member variables are typed references
member functions are function pools (possibly containing a bound base object) with many different call operators to facilitate fast call dispatching in the best case and also include a slow path that chooses the best function for the args then converts and calls if unambiguous
operator symbols are also interned in their own global and separate pool and access in the same way
operators additionally 
- all members references are typed variable references
  - member variables return setters and getters and operators
  - calls symbols are interned in their own pool and access as array indices for speed in the best case. in the worst case, call arguments are dynamically converted

ref-counting
  possibly (probly not) weighted ref-counting:
    initial refs start at high value
    sharing the ref splits the value
    sharing a ref with a weight of one needs to get more weight from the actual ref count
    could also extend to 

symbols:
- "[_]": subscript/array index operator
- "+=_", "-=_", "*=_", "/=_": 

underscores are replaced with type info e.g. "[_]" with 2 int parameters would be "[Int, Int]"
